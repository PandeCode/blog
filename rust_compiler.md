Rust is a modern systems programming language known for its performance and safety. However, compiling Rust code can sometimes feel slow, especially for large projects. This is how I optimize my Rust build times using caching, a high-performance linker, and configuration tweaks.

## Why Is Rust Compilation Slow?

The Rust compiler (rustc) performs several tasks:

1. Parsing and analyzing source code.
   - Rust performs additional tasks compared to ordinary compilers, such as borrow checking, detecting integer overflows, and catching common runtime bugs at compile time.
2. Optimizing the intermediate representation (IR).
3. Linking the final binary.

These steps can be computationally intensive. The good news is that tools like **sccache** and **mold** can significantly reduce compile and link times, respectively.

## Optimizing Cargo Build Configuration

### Step 1: Configure the `Cargo.toml`

Edit your project's `Cargo.toml` file to include the following settings:

```toml
[build]
target-dir = "/home/<your-username>/.cache/target"
rustc-wrapper = "sccache"

[target.x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu]
linker = "clang"
rustflags = ["-C", "link-arg=--ld-path=/usr/bin/mold"]
```

### Explanation of Configuration

1. **`target-dir`:**
   - Specifies the directory where Cargo places build artifacts. By using a shared cache directory (e.g., `/home/<your-username>/.cache/target`), incremental builds across multiple projects become faster. If you have used Node.js before and have come across **pnpm** as a solution to npm's large `node_modules` directories, this approach provides a similar fix.

2. **`rustc-wrapper`:**
   - Sets **sccache** as the compiler wrapper. **sccache** caches compilation outputs, so unchanged files are compiled only once, even across different builds.

3. **`linker` and `rustflags`:**
   - Configures **clang** and **mold** as the high-performance linker backend. Mold is optimized for speed, drastically reducing link times.

## Installing the Tools

You can use absolute paths, though I prefer placing them in the `PATH` for easier access.

### Install sccache

**sccache** is a caching compiler wrapper for Rust and other languages. It caches compiled output to avoid redundant work.

- [sccache](https://github.com/mozilla/sccache)

Verify it is in your `PATH`:

```bash
which sccache
```

### Install mold

**mold** is a high-performance linker designed to minimize link times.

- [mold](https://github.com/rui314/mold)

Verify the installation:

```bash
which mold
```

---

## Example

Here’s how the setup speeds up your build process:

1. **Caching with sccache:**
   - When you recompile unchanged code, **sccache** skips the compilation and retrieves the cached output, saving significant time.

2. **Fast linking with mold:**
   - By replacing the default linker with **mold**, you’ll notice a significant reduction in the time spent on linking during compilation.

### Benchmarking the Improvements

Use `cargo build` with and without the optimizations and observe the difference:

```bash
# Without optimization
cargo clean && time cargo build

# With optimization
cargo clean && time cargo build
```

This difference will continue to grow as **sccache** kicks in for subsequent builds.

## Additional Tips

- Use **`cargo check`** for faster compile cycles when you’re not generating a binary. This skips the linking phase altogether. You may realize you don’t have to run your program all the time; just check if it is compiling. This is a common tactic:

```bash
cargo check
```

- Enable **incremental compilation** by default (usually enabled unless you’re in release mode):

```toml
[profile.dev]
incremental = true
```
- Use the [nightly build of rust](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/channels.html#working-with-nightly-rust)

---

## Conclusion

By integrating **sccache** and **mold** into your Rust workflow, you can drastically reduce build times. Whether you’re working on a single project or managing multiple Rust codebases, these optimizations will save time and make development more efficient.
